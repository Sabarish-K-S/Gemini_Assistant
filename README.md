This project is a Gemini AI Assistant that I built using the Google Gemini Free Tier API key.
The application is consisting of:

ReactJS for the frontend 

Spring Boot for the backend API layer

Gemini Free Tier API for generating intelligent AI responses


For responsive design, I used the Clamp Calculator tool: https://marcbacon.com/tools/clamp-calculator/ An excellent tool that helped me make the website fully responsive 

Since the project uses the free-tier Gemini API key, please use the application responsibly and keep your usage within the free-tier limits:
